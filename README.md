## Bryan and Stephan's Hackathon Collab

### Thoughts

- (Stephan) I liked this hackathon a lot. It was fun to play around with vue and tailwind and explore what we can do. We were both very satisfied with the results of our web page.

### TO-DO

- Fix header alignment
  - Resolved by adding `absolute` to the `TheNavLog`
